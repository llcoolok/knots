                <h2 class="section-title">overview</h2>
                
                <p>The decision to ship our bikes to Japan marked a threshold between planning and commitment. After months of studying maps and researching routes, the act of boxing our gear and releasing it to international freight transformed abstract possibility into tangible journey. When we arrived in Fukuoka to reclaim those boxes, jet-lagged and uncertain, the adventure officially began.</p>

                <p>Shikoku, Japan's fourth-largest island, offered the perfect canvas for our first international bicycle touring experience. Less touristed than Honshu yet thoroughly connected by roads and infrastructure, the island balances accessibility with a sense of discovery. The famous 88-temple pilgrimage circuit winds around its perimeter, but our route would cut across the interior, threading together coastal roads, mountain passes, and rural valleys.</p>

                <div class="quote-callout">
                    "There's a particular vulnerability that comes with cycling in a place where you don't speak the language—every interaction becomes more intentional, more carefully negotiated. The bike becomes not just transportation but a conversation starter, a universal language of its own."
                </div>

                <p>We had plotted the first six days in detail: ferry crossings, accommodation stops, estimated mileage. Beyond that, we left space for spontaneity and adaptation. This balance between structure and flexibility would define the journey—enough planning to feel prepared, enough openness to allow for serendipity and response to what we encountered along the way.</p>

                    <div class="gallery-image wide">[Coastal road view]</div>
                </div>

                <h2 class="section-title">route highlights</h2>

                <p>The route began along Shikoku's northern coast, where the Seto Inland Sea fragments into countless small islands. Morning light on calm water, fishing boats heading out, the smell of salt and diesel. The coastal roads were mostly flat, allowing us to find our rhythm with fully loaded bikes and adjust to riding on the left side of the road.</p>

                <p>By day three, we turned inland toward the mountains. The climb to Iya Valley tested our conditioning and our gear choices. Steep switchbacks through dense forest, occasional shrines marking the roadside, and very few other cyclists. The valley itself felt suspended in time—traditional thatched-roof houses, vine bridges spanning gorges, and an almost palpable sense of remoteness despite the paved roads.</p>

                <p>What struck us most was the hospitality extended to cyclists. Convenience stores became reliable waypoints for supplies and respite. Small restaurants welcomed us with curiosity about our journey. Several times, locals stopped to offer directions or recommendations, communicating through gesture and broken English, always patient with our attempts at basic Japanese phrases.</p>

                <p>What began as careful execution of a planned route gradually evolved into something more fluid. By the end of the first week, we'd developed rhythms and intuitions—when to push through a climb, when to stop for photographs, how to read the weather and adjust pace accordingly.</p>

                <p>The bicycle proved to be the perfect vehicle for this kind of cultural immersion. Moving at human speed through the landscape, accessible to spontaneous interactions, capable of reaching both major destinations and hidden corners. We covered distances that would be trivial by car but felt substantial by bike, each kilometer earned through effort and attention.</p>

                <p>Beyond the six planned days, we continued for another week, making decisions based on weather, energy levels, and recommendations from people we met. The route became less about following a predetermined path and more about responding to opportunities and intuitions as they arose. This balance—between planning and spontaneity, between structure and freedom—became the journey's defining characteristic.</p>

                <p>Shikoku taught us what bicycle touring could be: challenging but manageable, structured yet flexible, solitary yet connected to the places and people we encountered. It set a template we'd carry into future journeys—the confidence that comes from successfully navigating the unfamiliar, the value of leaving room for improvisation, and the understanding that the best routes are often discovered rather than planned.</p>
